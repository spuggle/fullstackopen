My progress in the fullstack course by the University of Helsinki

## Repository Structure
Each folder in the base directory contains my solutions to exercises for each part of the course. The folder name represents the part the solutions in it correspond to.

Each part folder contains a `solutions` folder which contains all corresponding , and optionally a `progress` folder which contains the code I wrote when going through the course contents of that part.

Solutions may or may not be nested under a folder. These folders are labelled according to the exercise number they correspond to.
